# shopping-cart
Developed in html5, css, and vanilla JS.

This project is a responsive shopping cart, where on the one hand there will be a section of products that we obtain from a FETCH to the API, which is provided from www.omdapi.com, specifically from the endpoint: https: // www. omdbapi.com/?i=tt3896198&apikey=372bc176, we can see the product on cards, and add them to our shopping cart, where we can automatically select the number of units to purchase of this product and it will dynamically increase or decrease the total in money of our purchase, as well as the total of products that we are buying, to the extent that we manipulate the quantity selection input.
